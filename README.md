# Predict-Diabetes-problem-
To predict if a person has diabetes or not using decision tree with an accuracy of 77%
By removing one feature I got an accuracy percentage of 76%
I added both files differently

Describing the scipe of this project diabetes is one of the main problem faced by many people in presebt world. But the main sorrow is that many might even dont know if there are suffering from it and by the time they realize its might be too late. So to prevent this I used a machine learning algorithm called Decision tree Classifier to predict if aperson is suffering from diabetes or he might have a chance to get diabetes in future. The accuracy of my classifier is 78% but if we consider the case of might have the chance then the accuracy is around 91%.
